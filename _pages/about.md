I'm a self-motivated and passionate algorithm engineer for ExoAnalytic Solutions. I apply, develop, and deploy cutting-edge deep learning techniques to arduous real-world problems in space and defense. Primarily, I focus on fusion of first-principle knowledge alongside the robust generalization of neural networks and uncertainty modeling.
